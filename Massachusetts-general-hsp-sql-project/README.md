# SQL Portfolio Project: Maven Hospital Challenge

## Overview

This project showcases my SQL skills by analyzing a hospital dataset, demonstrating my proficiency in using various SQL functions to extract insights and solve problems.

## Objectives

* Analyze patient status, including total patients, living patients, and deceased patients
* Classify patients by gender
* Calculate total cost by encounter class and insurance coverage
* Identify top encounter reasons and procedures
* Analyze year-over-year revenue and revenue growth rate
* Examine payer key metrics, including total claims, insurance coverage, and patient counts
* Investigate encounters by patient and average hours spent on encounters
* Alter the patients table to include patient names
* Retrieve column names from the patients table
* Group patients by age

* Advanced functions:
	+ Window functions (ROW_NUMBER, RANK, etc.)
	+ Aggregate functions (SUM, AVG, etc.)
	+ Subqueries
	+ Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
	+ Indexing and optimization techniques
* Data analysis and visualization

## Project Highlights

* Analyzed a large hospital dataset to identify trends and patterns

# SQL Creative Project: Olympics History Analysis

## Overview

This project showcases my SQL skills by analyzing a dataset containing 120 years of Olympics history, demonstrating my proficiency in using various SQL functions to extract insights and solve problems.

## Objectives

* Reveal the team that has won the maximum gold medals over the years
* Identify the team that won the maximum silver medals and the year in which they won
* Determine the player who has won the maximum gold medals amongst those who have only won gold medals
* Identify the player who won the maximum gold medals in each year
* Determine the event and year in which India won its first gold, silver, and bronze medals
* Find players who won gold medals in both summer and winter Olympics
* Find players who won gold, silver, and bronze medals in a single Olympics
* Find players who won gold medals in consecutive summer Olympics in the same event

## SQL Skills Demonstrated

* Advanced functions:
	+ Window functions (ROW_NUMBER, RANK, etc.)
	+ Aggregate functions (SUM, AVG, etc.)
	+ Subqueries
	+ Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
	+ Indexing and optimization techniques

## Project Highlights

* Analyzed a large Olympics history dataset to identify trends and patterns
* Utilized advanced SQL functions to extract insights 

## About Dataset

* Which player has won maximum gold medals amongst the players who have only won gold medals?
* In each year, which player has won maximum gold medals?
* In which event and year did India win its first gold, silver, and bronze medals?
* Find players who won gold medals in both summer and winter Olympics
* Find players who won gold, silver, and bronze medals in a single Olympics
* Find players who won gold medals in consecutive summer Olympics in the same event



## Conclusion

This project demonstrates my SQL skills and ability to extract insights from a large dataset. I hope you find this project helpful in understanding my SQL expertise.
